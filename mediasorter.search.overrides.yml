# Search overrides
# Useful if you have some search term that sortfile is generating which does not work reliably.
# Use this dictionary, where the key is whatever sortfile generates, and the value is what you
# want to search instead, to override the actual search with another one.
# For example, "S.W.A.T." (TV show) ends up searching "s w a t" which matches another show, so
# you can use this example entry to override that.
# Add your own as needed; this list is populated by my own findings. PRs to add to this list
# are also welcome if you find shows or movies affected.
movies:
  "ghandi": "gandhi"
shows:
  "s w a t": "swat"
  "Haló, Haló!": "allo allo"
